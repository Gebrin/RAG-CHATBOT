**Query Answering Application using Streamlit,Mixtral 8x7B and OpenAI**   **RAG**

Introduction:-
This Python code represents a simple Query Answering Application using the Streamlit framework and Mixtral 8x7B and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. 
The application allows users to upload PDF documents, ask questions related to the content of those documents, and receive answers generated by both Mixtral 8x7B and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

Code Overview:-
  - Importing Libraries:
        The necessary libraries are imported, including Streamlit, OpenAI, PyPDF2 for PDF processing, and various components from the LangChain library.
  - PDF Processing:
        The get_pdf_text function reads text content from uploaded PDF documents.
  - Text Chunking:
        The get_text_chunks function splits the text into manageable chunks, making it suitable for processing.
  - Vectorization:
        The get_vectorstore function uses Hugging Face embeddings and FAISS to vectorize the text chunks, creating a vector store.
  - Conversation Chain Setup:
        The get_conversation_chain function sets up a conversational retrieval chain using Mistral model from Hugging Face Hub and the previously created vector store.
  - User Input Handling:
        The handle_userinput function manages user interactions. It uses GPT-3.5-turbo for generating responses based on user input.
  - Main Application:
    The Streamlit application is set up in the main function.

**Users can ask questions via a text input field.PDF documents can be uploaded and processed using the "Process" button.
The application maintains conversation history and allows users to interact with the model.**

Usage:-
  - Asking Questions:
      Users input questions related to the uploaded PDF documents.
      The application uses GPT-3.5-turbo to generate responses and also Mixtral 8x7B.
  - Conversational History:
      The application maintains a conversation history to provide context-aware responses.

How to Run:-
    
    - Install the required libraries using :- pip install streamlit,openai,PyPDF2,langchain.
    
    - Replace 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX' with your OpenAI API key and 'XXXXXXXXXXX' with your Hugging Face Hub API token.
    
    - Run the script using 'streamlit run main.py'.
